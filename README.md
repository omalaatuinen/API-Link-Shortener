# API-Link-Shortener
Author: Alexey Kokorev. This is a link shortener, which communicates with a web service is.gd by API. You can specify the short url's ending (optionally) (at least 5 symbols).  If ending for a future url has been used, the result should be like this: is.gd/yourending . If url's ending's fielt is empty, url will be generated automatically by is.gd. After getting result, You can copy a new url by clicking on it. If You would like to be redirected to a new url, just empty both fields, and enter a new url's ending (not the url itself) into the first field, then press Enter. Redirection can be used separately (without shortening).  The redirection option might be useful on a TV browsers, in order to get a quick access to a specific url. In that case, link to my program can be saved in the tv browser favorites.
